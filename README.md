# EXPRESS-CODE-GEN

This is a script to generate a full scalable express server code boilerplate. With consideration of best practices.

This will help node js backend engineers to spin up a project very quickly without bothering about writing the code base from scratch.

Folder structure generated include:

- services
- routes
- controllers
- config
- bin
- utils
- middlewares
- dataAcess
- models



These also include files like database configuration, logging and lots more.

To generate code, type the command `npx express-code-gen`

And this would do its magic. Cheers ðŸ˜ƒ
